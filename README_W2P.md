web2Project
================

web2Project is an Open Source system for online project management.  It is based on an AMP-stack which means it is designed to run on Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

The best part is that it's free software. That means you can use it, extend it, customize it, delete it, change the colors of things, and even break it... all for free. We won't (and can't) demand payment, but that also means you can't demand help. Well, you can but then you look like a jerk and no one wants that.

## Requirements

*  PHP 8.3.0+
*  Mysql 8.x+
*  Apache 1.x+ or IIS 7+
*  PHP extensions:
  *  GD  (for Gantt Chart generation)
  *  mbstring (only if you're using multi-byte strings)
  *  zlib (for output compression)

## Installing
