Installation of your web2project system is quite simple.

1.  Create a mysql database and a user with full access to the database.  
Write these credentials down.  If you are converting from dotProject, copy 
the includes/config.php file from your dotProject installation into your 
web2project/includes/ folder.  The conversion process will retrieve and use 
these credentials as necessary.

2.  Point your browser to your web2project installation.  The install script 
should determine whether you are doing a fresh install, updating an existing 
installation, or even converting from dotProject.

3.  
a.  If you're installing a new system, you'll need the credentials from Step 1.
b.  If you're upgrading an existing system, the system handles everything.
c.  If you're converting from dotProject, the system handles the conversion.

4.  After the script is complete, review the error messages.  You may have to 
manually create your config.php file from the information displayed.

5.  log into your system.
